# USA Airports Web Map
This web map is created using Leaflet JS that shows all the airports in the United States. You can interact with it here: <https://kiku511.github.io/usa-airports-viz/>

## Description
Each state is colored according to the number of airports in it. You can also click on each airport to get a popup with some more details about them. If the icon for an airport is red it means it does not have an air traffic control tower. I also used Leaflet plugins for a full screen mode and minimap to make the map even more interactive.
